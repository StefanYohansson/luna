# Summary
This proposal sets out the architecture and detailed design for the new Luna
runtime. This runtime aims to bring both increased performance to Luna, and to
provide a consistent and powerful base for the future evolution of the language.
It includes the runtime itself, as well as support machinery such as the IDE
protocol, FFI, and JIT.

# Motivation
For Luna to reach its full potential as a general-purpose programming language
and data-processing environment, it needs one major thing: speed. With the goal
for the language to become _the_ platform for end-to-end development and
communication, spanning from engineers all the way to executives, it needs to be
able to get out of the user's way and work in the background. In other words,
and to take a leaf from Apple's book: it should Just Work.

The current Luna runtime was never intended for long-term or production use, and
has been relied upon far longer than it should. During that period of time, the
design goals for Luna and its platform have solidified, making this the perfect
opportunity to deliver a new runtime that accommodates those goals while
delivering increased performance, and future-proof capabilities.

In doing so, Luna's performance will be dramatically increased, but that is only
one of the major benefits. Alongside this, the new runtime will allow Luna to be
decoupled from Luna Studio via the IDE protocol. It will let Luna interact with
C libraries with negligible overhead. It will, in essence, let Luna achieve its
full potential.

This design document sets out both the high-level architecture of the new
runtime, including detailed explorations of its features and concerns, but it
also contains the detailed designs and implementation plans for each portion of
the new Luna platform. It is intended to both serve as a design plan for the
implementation and, once that is all complete, as documentation for Luna's
design as it evolves.

# Architectural Overview
It is perhaps a touch rich to call this design the 'runtime', as it actually
encompasses a broader portion of the compiler than what would traditionally be
considered a runtime. Due to some of the design goals for Luna, this design also
encompasses changes to the type-checker, the IDE protocol, a JIT, and various
other things necessary for making this all work.

The Luna runtime is based on heavy usage of the Haskell-independent
infrastructure provided by the [GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc)
project. This is because we want to take advantage of the incredibly
sophisticated GHC RTS, as it provides facilities for concurrency, parallelism,
FFI, and garbage collection, alongside others. GHC will be used to provide the
GHC Core IR, from which we will be able to generate STG for use with the GHC
bytecode interpreter (used in GHCi), and for native compilation and dynamic
loading as part of the JIT.

The Luna Runtime integrates across most of the current design for the Luna
compiler, so it's easier instead to diagram the whole compiler, as below. In
this diagram, the direction of arrows represents the flow of information.

While the diagram above encompasses all of the components of the eventual Luna
compiler architecture, the following components are those that are described
within this design:

- **Edge Layer:**
- **Protocol Layer:**
- **Typechecker:**
- **Compilation Layer:**
- **Cache Layer:**
- **Bytecode Interpreter:**
- **JIT Tier 1:**
- **FFI:**
- **Tracing Engine:**
- **Debugging Engine:**
- **GHC RTS:**

## Runtime Layers
The Luna runtime consists of a number of discrete layers from a design
standpoint, each of which handles a separate part of the runtime's function.
While the responsibilities of these layers are usually well-defined, they will
need to be fairly tightly integrated, primarily for performance.

Please note that these layers aren't intended to relate directly to
architectural components at the code level. There will likely be the need for
additional components, and some of these layers may actually be different uses
of the same architectural component (e.g. the JIT layers).

<!--
- A set of brief descriptions of each of the layers.
- A diagram that shows how they interact, and the approximate communication flow
  between them.
-->

### 1 - The Edge Layer
<!--
- A diagram of the interactive file-system watching.
- A diagram of the protocol interactions.
- This layer handles:
  + Managing code files.
  + Managing and watching data on disk.
  + Communication between the runtime and the protocol client.
- A description of the strategy to determine when to reload data based on disk
  changes.
-->

### 2 - The Protocol Layer
<!--
- An analysis of what is required to efficiently parse and respond to protocol
  messages.
- A description of the unified protocol that handles explicit control over the
  runtime's operation, as well as the features required by an IDE-protocol.
- The IDE-protocol portion should reflect discussions with David (held on email
  and recorded here: https://github.com/luna/luna/issues/365)
- A list of the protocol messages with informal descriptions (spec to come
  later).
- A description of protocol support for performance data collection (potentially
  integrated with the IDE protocol).
- A description of protocol support for debugging (integrated with the IDE
  protocol).
- A description of how to design the protocol to admit extensions.
- An examination of how this supports building a rich REPL interface, and how it
  supports Luna Studio.
- A description of how files are controlled based on the protocol impl, and how
  they should be hosted by the Luna process.
- A description of the interaction between the protocol and the typechecker.
- A description of how changesets for open files should be handled.
- A mechanism for handling the notion of active and passive 'layers', as well as
  on-demand optimisation.
- An analysis of how the graph layout and metadata is handled. This should not
  longer be associated with explicit metadata in the source.
- An analysis of how to handle the necessary callbacks to this layer
-->

### 3 - The Compilation Layer and Type-Checker
<!--
- A diagram of the compilation process.
- A description of the interaction between this and Luna-native passes.
- A list of requirements placed on the Luna Core optimiser to allow for
  generation of proper GHC core (e.g. generating core for TCO).
- The code-generator will have to handle explicit strictness annotations.
- A list of things to encode in GHC Core and things that get erased. Particular
  focus on our type-system and whether we should (or how we can) encode rows.
- A description of the compilation strategy: eager + on-demand loading to ensure
  that as little time as possible is spent waiting.
- An analysis of how on-demand evaluation for type-checking should work. A
  restriction on what can be encoded (can only evaluate known-typed exprs).
- A design for exposing a hierarchical structure for optimisation passes (e.g.
  `+Pass.Optimisation.TCO`).
- An analysis of Luna-side optimisations required for the new runtime.
- An analysis of what type-erasure (if any) we can get away with at the Luna
  level (in the end GHC will type-erase our core). Any retained type info should
  be contained in-line in the Luna IR.
- An analysis of how to avoid explicitly encoding any types in the assumptions
  of the rest of the runtime (allowing for later addition of dependent and
  linear types).
- While Luna is statically typed, the runtime manipulation of types provides
  less opportunities for usage-analysis based erasure than languages like Idris
  or Agda. However, it is likely still possible that we can apply a
  usage-analysis pass to the Luna Core graph. Think about the `Dynamic` type.
- The analysis of _relevance_ of type information is interesting, and
  potentially we can learn some lessons from the progress of Dependent Haskell.
- A list of things that we need to avoid in the generated core (e.g. an
  excessive number of coercions).
- An analysis of the potential implementation burden from additions to GHC core.
- An analysis of techniques that this layer can employ to minimise the runtime
  start-up time:
  + **Dynamic Layering:** Precompilation of portions of code not in the active
    layer could be performed. This would provide increased performance, but
    there must be significant care taken to ensure that appropriate code is
    deoptimised when necessary (de-specialisation).
  - **Optimisation without Tracing:** Code that is compiled in the background
    can have general optimisations done to it that can then be improved upon
    using the input from the tracing process later on.
  - **Static Tracing:** The decisions on the order for background optimisation
    can be made via static analysis on the Luna IR graph. The code that is used
    'soonest' from the `main` function should be compiled and optimised first.
  - **Library Precompilation:** There is some potential to ship our compiler
    with (platform-specific) precompiled-to-bytecode libraries.
  - **Parallelism:** The listed startup tasks should happen in parallel as much
    as possible. The biggest opportunity for this is likely the generation of
    GHC Core from the Luna IR, but parsing can also potentially be parallelised
    (but requires discovery to be done properly).
  - **Tailored Passes:** Based on the kinds of execution that functions are
    seeing it is possible to select sets of Luna IR and GHC Core optimisation
    passes to best improve that function's performance.
-->

### 4 - The Cache Layer
<!--
- The actual architecture of the runtime cache:
  + A description of the keying strategy.
  + A description of the dependency-tracking strategy.
  + A description of the eviction strategies in use, especially concerning type
    alterations and specialisation. It needs to account for changes in (inputs,
    outputs, type (incl. Monad, Exception), code, and code that it depends on or
    depends on it, strictness).
  + The mechanisms by which it allows for hot-reloading (keeping data around
    where possible)
  + The LRU mechanism that maintains some N sets of in/out for each code block.
  + The unit of program functionality that the cache works with: what the level
    of granularity and whether it should be tunable
- A diagram of the cache architecture and sharding approach
- A discussion of how we compensate for the magic of the cache in predictable
  performance: some portions of the caching should be _optional_ to aid in this.
- An accounting for how strictness and laziness interact with the cache.
- A description of how the cache interacts with layer 1, making it IO-aware.
- An analysis of _what_ to cache, and how it can be tuned for memory (and disk)
  usage (e.g. caching of infinite structures).
- An examination of how cache state can potentially be serialised to disk to
  load projects more quickly (needs to handle external changes to the code and
  invalidate the loaded cache based on this).
- This should be informed by Skip, a programming language that caches results
  where possible.
-->

### 5 - The Byte-Code Interpreter
<!--
- A description of how the GHC bytecode interpreter will be used to evaluate
  Luna programs.
- A description of how the JIT'ed code is going to be linked back into the
  interpreter process and the JIT hot-swap mechanism (e.g. the 'plugins')
  mechanism.
- An analysis of the interpreter's role in type-checking, allowing for
  evaluation of programs to compute types, and then graph reduction by the Luna
  TC and optimiser. Graph reduction as an optimisation strategy.
- An analysis of how best to combine strict evaluation with optional laziness.
-->

### 6 - JIT
<!--
- An examination of the kind of optimisations would be performed by this JIT
  tier (the specifics can come later).
- A description of the trade-off this JIT layer makes.
- An analysis of how we can use the W^X mitigation.
- An examination of the JIT as a solution to non-type-erased code.
- An analysis of the approximate optimisation pipeline (e.g. Luna IR -> GHC Core
  -> Core2Core -> STD -> Native Code -> Load into JIT)
- An examination of the kind of optimisations would be performed by subsequent
  JTI tiers.
- A description of why we want a second JIT stage, and the anticipated
  performance benefits.
- A discussion of the drawbacks of subsequent JIT stages (primarily compilation
  cost).
- An analysis of how the optimisation pipeline would differ across JIT tiers.
-->

### 7 - JIT Tier 2
<!--
- An examination of the kind of optimisations would be performed by this JIT
  tier (the specifics can come later).
- A description of why we want a second JIT stage, and the anticipated
  performance benefits.
- A discussion of the drawbacks of this layer (primarily compilation cost).
- An analysis of how the optimisation pipeline would differ in this tier.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
There are a number of elements of the design for the new runtime that cannot be
easily partitioned into the above layers. These are explored below from the
standpoint of requirements and high-level design, and will be integrated into
multiple (if not all) of the above layers.

### 1 - FFI
<!--
- A diagram of how FFI calls work, and the support libraries needed.
- A description of how we want FFI to work, and its performance characteristics.
- A list of what we need from user code to provide enough information to the
  backend to properly encode the FFI calls.
- A description of how we will ensure that FFI calls remain as low-overhead as
  possible.
- An analysis of what types can be used across the C-FFI boundary. Support for
  value structs where possible (using compiler layout assumptions).
- An analysis of the potential to support callbacks to Luna from C, and the
  support for running Luna programs from C.
- An analysis of how best to translate Haskell's FFI semantics into Luna.
- The interpreter itself currently doesn't support `foreign export`, so these
  will need to be compiled by the first JIT tier separately and then dynamically
  loaded.
-->

### 2 - Tracing Engine
<!--
- A description of the mechanisms by which execution is traced.
- A description of _what_ data is tracked and how it is used to make decisions
  about the JIT. Time and memory.
- An examination of which portions of this are required for phase one of the
  implementation.
- A description of how this functionality can be used for inbuilt performance
  tracking.
- An examination of what traces are used for:
  + Forced inlining of traces to ensure optimisation of the whole trace.
  + Performance annotation.
- An exploration of how we trace enough data without slowing down the bytecode
  interpreter stage too much. Tracing calls will be eliminated in the JIT'ed
  code.
- An examination of how performance tracing can be achieved based on the JIT's
  trace.
- An exploration of what mechanisms we can apply to get faster warm-up times
  (e.g. static tracing, on-demand optimisation). Minimisation of the necessary
  initial tasks:
  1. Lexing and Parsing of Luna source code, coupled with generation of the Luna
     IR graph.
  2. Type-checking of Luna IR and any reduction that may take place (see later).
  3. Generation of GHC Core from Luna IR.
  4. Translation of Core to Bytecode for initial interpretation.
- An examination of how the JIT's automatic optimisation should interact with
  the on-demand optimisation available to Luna Studio.
- An analysis of the stages of trace information:
  1. Profiling information is collected during execution. This is traditionally
     for loops (or recursive calls), but can be augmented to compute hot paths
     and other useful information.
  2. Once a code path is considered 'hot', the JIT records an execution trace of
     the exact instructions executed, including functions for inlining. This
     trace is often stored as IR, but Luna can do better by annotating the IR
     graph.
  3. The resultant trace consists of one execution path, which can be optimised
     easily. Guard instructions are inserted as appropriate into the trace to
     ensure that the assumptions made during collection still hold.
  4. The trace is optimised, including CSE, dead-code elimination, escape
     analysis, heavy inlining and constant folding.
  5. The compiled trace is executed until a guard fails, forcing deoptimisation.
-->

### 3 - Concurrency
<!--
- An exploration of how the runtime will need to handle concurrency.
- A description of which GHC primitives and RTS operations we can rely on.
- A description of how the bytecode interpreter helps achieve concurrency in the
  new runtime.
- An analysis of techniques for automatic parallelism that defer to manual
  parallelism where necessary. How do these interact with stateful and IO-based
  computation?
- An analysis of how GHC's concurrency primitives can be used to retain as much
  concurrency performance as possible.
- An exploration of techniques to avoid async/await 'colour'.
-->

### 4 - Debugging Engine
<!--
- An examination of how performance tracing can be achieved based on the JIT's
  trace.
- A description of what features we want out of the debugger.
- An examination of what kind of debugging support we can get for free from the
  bytecode interpreter, and what we would need to build on top.

# Unresolved Questions
This section should address any unresolved questions you have with the RFC at
the current time. Some examples include:

- Is there potential to upstream portions of the JIT into GHC itself? This could
  bring a whole new execution paradigm to the Haskell ecosystem if so.
- What kind of maintenance burden can we expect when changing to new GHC
  versions? The GHC API tends to change fairly often, so we have to account for
  that in the design.
- Is it worth creating our own wrapper around the necessary parts of the GHC API
  to allow the change surface on version bumps to be minimised? Some use of
  type-level programming could likely help with correctness around strictness
  and laziness, as well as boxed and unboxed types.
- What are the security implications for the language while building a JIT
  compiler?
- What is the exact boundary of stage 1. It looks like the JIT tier may be
  needed after all (for FFI). It may, in the end, actually be simpler to add
  this to GHC and use a fork until it hits stable.

# Glossary
This section is designed to define terms that may be unfamiliar to some users:

- **ABI** - Application Binary Interface: A well-specified and defined interface
  between multiple binary program components (as opposed to an API, which
  operates at the level of program code).
- **AOT** - Ahead of Time: The opposite of JIT compilation, where code is
  compiled to binaries ahead of being executed.
- **FFI** - Foreign Function Interface: A mechanism by which functions written
  in another language can be called, usually operating via the C ABI.
- **IR** - Intermediate Representation:
- **JIT** - Just in Time: Where compilation to binary or bytecode takes place as
  needed for the execution of the program.
- **RTS** - Runtime System: A program that provides the underlying primitives
  and functionality for a programming language to execute. When used in this
  document, it exclusively refers to the GHC Runtime System.
